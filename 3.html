  <h2>Ebola</h2>
  <p>According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/" target='_blank', title='WHO 세계 보건기구'>WHO</a>, Ebola virus disease (EVD),
    formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates</p>
  <img src="Ebola.jpg", width="90%">
  <p>The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates) and then spreads in the human population
    through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people,
    and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.</p>
  <p>The average EVD case <u>fatality rate is around <strong>50%</strong></u>. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.</p>
  </p><p>Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs.
  Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>
