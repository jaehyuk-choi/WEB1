  <h2>Coronavirus</h2>
  <p>According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/" target='_blank', title='WHO 세계 보건기구'>WHO</a>, a coronavirus is a virus that is found in animals and, rarely,
  <strong>can be transmitted from <u>animals to humans</u></strong> and then spread person to person.
  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans.
  Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.</p>
